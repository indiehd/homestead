# Inspired by the post at:

# Protocols we want to be serving.
protocols = imap

# Static passdb.

# This can be used for situations where Dovecot doesn't need to verify the
# username or the password, or if there is a single password for all users:
passdb {
  driver = static
  args = password=secret
  #args = allow_all_users=yes
  #args = nopassword=y
}

# Location for users' mailboxes. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot
# tries to find the mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user
# doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full
# location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the "root mail directory", and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# <doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt>
#
mail_location = mbox:/var/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

# System user and group used to access mails. If you use multiple, userdb
# can override these by returning uid or gid fields. You can use either numbers
# or names. <doc/wiki/UserIds.txt>
mail_uid = vagrant
mail_gid = mail

# Helpful debugging directives.

# Thunderbird complains about plaintext connections, and even though it allows
# the user to ignore the warnings, the author wasn't able to authenticate successfully
# without enabling TLS, as of 2016.07.07.
